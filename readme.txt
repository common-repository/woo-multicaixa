== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I start receiving payments right away? Show me the money! =

Nop! You have to sign a contract with ProxyPay and an Angolan bank in order to activate this service. Go to [https://proxypay.co.ao/](https://proxypay.co.ao/) for more information. They can help you out with all the subscription process with them and the bank.

= [WPML] My website is multilingual. Will I be able to use this plugin? =

Yes. This plugin is WPML compatible. You will need the WPML and WPML String Translation Plugins (alongside WooCommerce Multilingual, which is mandatory for any WooCommerce + WPML install). 

= [WPML] How can I translate the payment method title and description the client sees in the checkout page to secondary languages? =

Go to WPML > String Translation > Search and translate the `multicaixa_proxypay_gateway_title` and `multicaixa_proxypay_gateway_description`, strings in the `woocommerce` domain. Don‚Äôt forget to check the ‚ÄúTranslation is complete‚Äù checkbox and click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù. You should also translate the ‚ÄúExtra instructions‚Äù strings by searching the `multicaixa_proxypay_extra_instructions` string on the `woo_multicaixa`.

= [SMS] How to include the Multicaixa payment instructions in the SMS sent by ‚ÄúWooCommerce - APG SMS Notifications‚Äù, ‚ÄúTwilio SMS Notifications‚Äù or ‚ÄúYITH WooCommerce SMS Notification‚Äù? =

You‚Äôll need the [plugin PRO add-on](https://multicaixa-woocommerce.com).

= [SMS] How to trigger the ProxyPay SMS system? =

You‚Äôll need the [plugin PRO add-on](https://multicaixa-woocommerce.com).

= [Advanced] The order is set ‚ÄúOn Hold‚Äù, can I make it ‚ÄúPending‚Äù by default? =

I don‚Äôt know why on earth you would want to do this, but‚Ä¶ yes, you can. Just return `false` to the `multicaixa_proxypay_set_on_hold` filter.
Be advised that no ‚Äúnew order‚Äù email, with payment instructions, will be sent to the client unless you use some plugin or custom code to force it.

= [Advanced] Can I prevent the plugin from adding the payment instructions and/or the payment received message to emails? =

You can use the `multicaixa_proxypay_email_instructions_pending_send` filter: return false and the payment instructions won‚Äôt be included in the ‚Äúnew order‚Äù email ‚Äì we do not recommend you to do it, though.
You can use the `multicaixa_proxypay_email_instructions_payment_received_send` filter: return false and the payment received message won‚Äôt be included in the ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù email.

= [Advanced] How can I use the plugin with the ProxyPay sandbox, for tests? =

You should return true to the `multicaixa_proxypay_test_mode` filter, or use the [plugin PRO add-on](https://multicaixa-woocommerce.com) to activate the test mode with a simple checkbox.

= Can I contribute with a translation? =

Sure. Go to [GlotPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/woo-multicaixa) and help us out.
